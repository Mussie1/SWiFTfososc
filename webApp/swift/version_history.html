	so easy as it may seem. The previous challenge was still depended on
	some non-Scala code (Clean). EfeLang is completely written in Scala.
	Moreover, this has been done in an abstract, generic way. The latter
	allows other future challenges, with new CTL language and reasoning
	problems, to be integrated far more easily (I hope).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in">Moreover, the code is already
	partially prepared for allowing more than one challenge in the SWiFT
	game. Considerable refactoring has taken place, among other things,
	introducing some parameterized types to make it easier to add new
	challenges with improved reuse.</P>
