<h1 align=center>Constitution alpha</h1>
<h2 class="western">0. Game rules</h2>
<p>Acquaint yourself with the rules of the game.</p>
<h2 class="western">1. Definition of the target language: folnuminqua</h2>
<p>There is not one computationally transparent language. Just as in
the world of the, their can be many. The SWiFT game makes use of a
very simple computationally transparent language. The special thing
about computationally transparent langauges is that you are free to
introduce new words. Compared with a normal language (English) it
could be seen as a language with a grammar, but with a minimum of
predefined words. In a sense you extend the language (with new words)
while you are using it.</p>
<p>The target language is defined as follows. A document in
folnuminqua consists of a set of sentences, and sentences of a
sequence of words and auxiliary symbols. Lets first explain the
words, then the sentences and after that the documents.</p>
<h3 class="western">1.1 Words</h3>
<p>The words in Folminqua come in two flavours: constants and
predicates.</p>
<h4 class="western">1.1.1 Constants</h4>
<p>A constant is a word that stands for a certain entity (which could
be a person, a table, an armadillo, you name it). Examples of
constants in Folnuminqua are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>c1</b></p>
	<li><p><b>obama</b></p>
	<li><p><b>oeiruij</b></p>
	<li><p><b>pres_hujintao</b></p>
</ul>
<p>You are free to choose any constant for a thing you want to refer
to. You can choose the constant <b>Obama</b> to represent president
Obama, but you could just as well have chosen <b>c1</b>. Although you
are free to choose any constant to refer to the entity you have in
mind, you must stick to your choice throughout the document. Each new
occurrence of the same constant in the document, thus, refers to the
same entity. On the other hand, you are free to connect different
constants to the same entity, as long as not in conflict with the yet
to exlpain equal or inequal statements.</p>
<h4 class="western">1.1.2 Predicates</h4>
<p>A predicate stands for a certain relation between entities.
Examples of predicates are:</p>
<p><b>p</b></p>
<p><b>dlkfjiwjef</b></p>
<p><b>is_father_of</b></p>
<p><b>dk</b></p>
<p><b>likes</b></p>
<p>Just as with constants, you are free to choose any predicate for a
relation you want to refer to. Again, you must stick to your choice
throughout the document. Each predicate has a fixed number of
entities it expresses a relation between. In Folnuminqua, simple as
it is, this number must always be exactly 2.</p>
<p><b>inequal</b> and <b>equal </b>statements are not On the other
hand, you are free to connect different constants to the same entity,
as long as not in conflict with the yet to exlpain equal or inequal
statements</p>
<h3 class="western">1.2 Sentences</h3>
<p>We will explain the sentences by giving examples.</p>
<p>Compare it to: lets call Obama p1 and Hu Jintao p2. Then it is
true that p1 and p2 are both presidents.</p>
<p>The above statement expresses that the relation named p exists
between c1 and c2 (and in that order, will be explained)</p>
<p>Sentence:</p>
<p><b>p(c1,c2)</b></p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>we will call <b>c1</b> and <b>c2</b> constants, and <b>p</b> a
predicate.</p>
<p>Each constant stands for a certain entity (which could be a
person, a table, an armadillo, you name it) as defined by the player.</p>
<p>For example, <b>c1</b> could stand for your best friend <b>c2</b>
for the child of your best friend.</p>
<p>The predicate stands for a certain relation between entities. The
above statement expresses that the relation named p exists between c1
and c2 (and in that order, will be explained)</p>
<p>For example: p could be defined as follows: <b>p(x,y)</b>
expresses the relation “x is a parent of y”. In that case, the
statement above, p(c1,c2), expresses: c1 is parent of c2.</p>
<p>The order of constants is therefore important. p(c2,c1) and
p(c1,c2) do not necessarily express the same information.</p>
<p>Different constants may refer to the same entity, as long as not
in conflict with the equal or inequal statements (see below)</p>
<p>Constants and predicates are local names for entities and
relations, in the sense that you can pick any you want. You don’t
have to choose “Obama”. Compare it to: lets call Obama p1 and Hu
Jintao p2. Then it is true that p1 and p2 are both presidents.</p>
<p>In this game, only two place predicates are allowed. I.e. p(c1) is
not allowed, and neither is p(c1,c2,c3,c4)</p>
<p>equal(c1,c2,c3)</p>
<p>This expresses that the constants c1, c2 and c3 refer to the same
entity.</p>
<p>Any nuymber of constants above or equal to 2 may be in the list.
equal(c1) is incorrect, but equal(c1, c2,c3,c4,c5,c7) is correct.</p>
<p>The order of the is not of any importance. equal(c2,c3,c1) has the
same meaning.</p>
<p>equal is not a predica</p>
<p>unequal(c1,c2,c3)</p>
<p>This expresses that the constants c1, c2, c3 refer to mutually
distinct entities.</p>
<p>For the rest it has the same properties as equal.</p>
<h3 class="western">1.3 Documents</h3>
<p>A document is a sequence of sentences separated by newlines:</p>
<p>p(a,b)</p>
<p>p(b,c)</p>
<p>equal(b,c)</p>
<p><br><br>
</p>
<p>The meaning of constants and predicates do never change within a
document. p stands for the same relation and c1 and c2 for the same
entities throughout the document.</p>
<p>Which stand for some entities, and p is a relation. This statement
expresses</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>p stands for the relation “x is a father of y”</p>
<p><br><br>
</p>
<p>equal(a,b,c) a, band</p>
<p>p({a},{c,d}) is an abbreviation for</p>
<p>p(a,c)</p>
<p>p(a,d)</p>
