<h1>About the Developers</h1>
<!-- This page is about the developers of SWiFT. -->
<h2>Lead developer and founder</h2>
<h3>Chide Groenouwe</h3>
<p>The core of Chide's professional goal is formed by fostering human collective and individual intelligence through research and development. If associated projects revolve around specific applications or case studies, it is essential to him that these are in agreement with a deep respect for all humans, other life and our environment, and not in conflict with a sustainable life-style. Since his young adulthood, he tries to ever live more ecologically, socially and planetary aware.</p>

<p>He graduated from the faculty of applied mathematics at the Universiteit Twente, specialising in mathematical logic, in collaboration with the Universiteit Utrecht and the Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen. Since then he worked at several research and or educational institutes, on topics related to technically augmented human collective intelligence. Amongst others, he worked as a researcher in formal distributed knowledge representation and reasoning with the department of computer science of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>

<p>SWiFT was conceived by him as part of his quest to foster human collective intelligence, and focuses on fostering computational fluency among humans by means of (1) specially designed games for this purpose ("fluency games") (2) improved computer mediated collaborative work inspired by principles from nature (evolutionary biology) ("consti games"). In this way he hopes to connect people and technology in such a way that they can solve minor Ã¡nd major problems more creatively, collaboratively and efficiently.</p>

<p>Moreover, he acts as mentor to new creative talent, such as co-developer Koen van der Kruk. In this way he hopes to give them an opportunity to grow more quickly and richly, while they are also accelerating the development of the project, making a real contribution to society. Anyone willing to contribute as well in this way: don't hesitate to drop him a note!</p>

<h2>Co-developer</h2>
<h3>Koen van der Kruk</h3>
About a year ago I started working for Chide, and helped with his SWiFT project. Until that time I didn't have any experience with Scala or Git, I actually never heard of Scala because its a very new language. 
<br />
Most of the time I do bug fixes, or create new features for SWiFT. I'm not yet very good with scala and lift, so still learning those things. 
<br />
Before I knew of scala I created some android apps using Java, and also programmed in PHP, Unix, bash/batch scripting, Javascript, (X)HTML, CSS, C#. Since a while ago I'm also learning C++ with QT support.<br />
