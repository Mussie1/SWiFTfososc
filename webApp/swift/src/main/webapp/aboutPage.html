<h1>About the Developers</h1>

This page is about the developers of SWiFT.
<h2>Lead developer</h2>
<h3>Chide Groenouwe - TODO</h3>

<h2>Co-developer</h2>
<h3>Koen van der Kruk</h3>
About a year ago I started working for Chide, and helped with his SWiFT project. Until that time I didn't had any experience with Scala or Git, I actually never heard of Scala because its a very new language. 
<br />
Most of the time I do bug fixes, or create new features for SWiFT. I'm not yet very good with scala and lift, so still learning those things. 
<br />
Before I knew of scala I created some android apps using Java, and also programmed in PHP, Unix, bash/batch scripting, Javascript, (X)HTML, CSS, C#. Since a while ago I'm also learning C++ with QT support.<br />
